1️⃣ Understand the Concepts First
Before coding, make sure you’re clear on:

Scalar Subquery → Returns a single value.

Correlated Subquery → Runs for each row in the outer query.

Subquery in WHERE → Used for filtering.

Subquery in FROM → Acts as a derived table.

IN / EXISTS → For checking existence of matching records.

2️⃣ Pick a Sample Database
You can use:

SQLite sample database (Chinook, Northwind)

MySQL sample database (Sakila, World)

This ensures you have real tables to work with.

3️⃣ Example Queries to Include
Here’s how you can structure them:


4️⃣ Document Your Work
Create a README.md describing:

Which database you used.

Each query's purpose.

Example outputs (screenshots are a bonus).

5️⃣ Push to GitHub
Create a new repository (e.g., SQL-Task-6).

Add:

SQL file(s) with all queries.
